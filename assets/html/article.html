            <p>The three-part album "Themes" includes 176 compositions from the legendary series, created by  Marina Landa and Sergey Vasiliev. The music from the show could be found online, but none of these melodic themes had been officially released before and could only be heard in the animated series. But this did not stop fans from using the compositions to create videos and numerous memes on social networks. However, this all changed this November.
                <br/> <br/>
            On November 15, the people behind the series released the album, "Themes", on the Riki Music label. It includes instrumental soundtracks from all episodes of the animated series over the twenty-one years of the project's existence.
            </p>
            
            <p> <br/> <em>"As strange as it may sound, "Themes" is probably the most important music album for us. More precisely, not an album, but an archive... And even though there is still as much music beyond its borders, these three albums can safely be considered the complete musical legacy of Romashkova Dolina. It was very difficult and fun to compose music for Smeshariki! And when, twenty years later, we saw how many melodies become the subject of the viewer's attention, how differently they are played and re-played, we decided to open the doors to our creative laboratory and publish them the way they were written. Moreover, we included unheard versions of the themesin the album. They show the creative process, the search, and most importantly, the process. Your love and devotion to the round world pushed us to take this step. Thank you very much!"</em> shared Marina Landa and Sergey Vasiliev, composers of "Smeshariki".  
            </p>

            <p> For the convenience of the listener, the title of each track indicates the series in which this melody sounded, and each of the covers of the triple album uses the classic 2D style of "Smeshariki". Also in the collection there are several compositions that are dedicated to famous creative personalities, for example, the theme "Жизнь на облаке" from the album "Themes II" to the avant-garde musician Sergei Kuryokhin , and the melody "Путь в приличное общество" from the album "Themes III" - to the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi. Also, the artists of the "Musical Theater of Children of Marina Landa" participated in the formation of the album.
